# Data Scientist Coding Challenge
This repository is created for the submission of the ZEISS Data Scientist Coding Challenge.
For the coding challenge, I chose the second problem: <b>Customer Lead Generator</b>.
The source code is written in a Jupyter notebook to allow for a better readability of the discussions and explanations.
Additionally, I included the data file `CustomerData_LeadGenerator.csv` in the `data` directory if it is desired to re-run the source code.
